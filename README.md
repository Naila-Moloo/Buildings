For this project I predicted the Energy Star Score of buildings using a dataset from New York City. I went through every step of an ML workflow including data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering and selection, comparing models based on MAE, performing hyperparameter tuning and evaluating the best model, and interpreting the results using LIME. Having an effective model to predict the Energy Star Score of a building could be very impactful. Energy-efficient buildings are becoming more and more significant with the rise of the climate crisis, and not only can reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also save money for businesses. The final model was a Random Forest Regressor with an MAE of 9.5231.
